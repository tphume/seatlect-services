## **Overview**

This repository contains files related to the definition, configuration and generated code of the Seatlect's backend services. The design principles used are based on Google's general guide in API design which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).

In Seatlect there are two main API platform, HTTP and gRPC. The HTTP platform contains API used by our *business* users, it follows the RESTful design principles and is mostly CRUD based. Our gRPC API platform is used by Seatlect's mobile client for our standard users, the design is task oriented.
